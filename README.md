To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.
Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really** get your point across.

Of course, you can use _both italics and bold_ in the same line. You can also span them **across multiple words**.
In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or underscores. In the box below, make the words "This is unbelievable" both bold and italic. Place the asterisks **_on the outside_**, just to make it more legible.
